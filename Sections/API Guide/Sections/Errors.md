Handling Exceptions
===================
EPay Advantage uses HTTP response codes to indicate the completion status of requests. Below is a description of the meanings of the most common response codes that you will encounter. In general, status codes in the range of 200 to 299 indicate success. 400 to 499 indicate that the client has made a mistake. 500 and beyond indicate that EPay Advantage experienced an error.

| 200 OK | Request Successful | 
| 400 Bad Request | The request is missing required information. Verify that you are accessing the correct URL (including all query string parameters).
